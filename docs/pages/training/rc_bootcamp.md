# Research Computing Bootcamp

----

Research Computing Bootcamps are multi-day events, comprising several workshops designed for faculty members, students, postdoctoral fellows, and other researchers across campus to gain knowledge on how to use ARC in their research. Bootcamps also connect you with colleagues working in the same space to share knowledge, best practices, and get answers to your questions. These events run three times a year in fall, winter, and spring. Workshops cover a variety of topics such as Python, ARC clusters, and research cloud computing.

- How do you figure out what resources your job's needs on the cluster?
- Tips and tricks about being more productive using a cluster.
- Practice creating and submitting more complex jobs: parallel jobs, job arrays, memory requirements, job dependencies, gpus
- GPUs introduce complexity into scheduling, while a basic GPU job is simple, to be effective requires a much higher skill set.
