## **What is High Performance Computing (HPC)?**

----

High-performance computing (HPC) is the ability to run computations in a synchronized manner across a large number of networked computers. HPC makes it possible to run computations that are too large for regular computers, reducing the time it takes to complete large operations. HPC is also referred to as supercomputing, and high-performance computers are commonly referred to as supercomputers.


## **Who we are** 

----

The Sensitive Data Research Environment (SDRE) provides the University of Alberta research community with computational resources to enable sensitive scientific research.

We offer High Performance Computing cluster. Access to CPUs/GPUs, high-memory servers, data storage capacity, as well as personalized consultations and funding application consultations, are provided at no-cost.

## **Getting Started**

----

**Follow the steps below to access RCC services:**

1. Activate and manage your SDRE user account through <span style="color: red;"> portal/freshservice/.etc</span>.  
Note: Most SDRE services require an SDRE user account, which is separate from your CCID

2. 

    - If you have verified UofA device, connect to the UofA SDRE VPN service
   
    - If you are from UofA withoutd verified UofA device, connect to the UofA VPN service

    - If you are the researcher outside of University of Alberta, connect to the UofA guest VPN service

3. Start using our resources:

    - For VCS access to the HPC, check out Connecting to HPC

    - Read our documentation for connecting and using the HPC

    - Learn how to submit HPC jobs

    - For information about HPC storage, refer to the Parallel Storage webpage
