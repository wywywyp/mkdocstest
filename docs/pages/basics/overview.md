The Sensitive Data Research Environment (SDRE) is a secure, scalable, stable and robust high-performance platform developed to support research involving legislated, regulated, or contractually sensitive data at the University of Alberta.

Aligned with national research security guidelines and the university’s strategic goals, SDRE offers access to advanced computing resources—CPUs, GPUs, high-memory nodes, and fast storage—along with expert support to help researchers accelerate sensitive-data projects and meet compliance requirements.
