If you are not a current member of University of Alberta, you can gain access to SDRE provided that you are sponsored by a faculty member of University of Alberta who has already set up a project/planned to request a project account in SDRE. To begin the account request process, have your Faculty Sponsor email SDRE (SDRE email) and provide:

- Your name,
- The reason you need (continued) access to SDRE resources,
- The amount of time they would like to sponsor your account,
- Your city/country of residence, and
- Your institution.

SDRE staff will then follow up with next steps to create or extend your account.

Your faculty sponsor can sponsor your account for up to one year at a time. If you need continued access past one year, your faculty sponsor must contact us and re-confirm that you should have continued access.

Our policy is that SDRE accounts are deactivated and user data is erased after a user is no longer actively using their account (~1 year of inactivity). It is your responsibility to maintain your data and important files in a location that is not SDREâ€™s file systems.
