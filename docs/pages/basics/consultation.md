# **Consultation**

----

A consultation is the best starting point for anyone looking for research computing options. Consultation is **free** for University of Alberta researchers across all disciplines.  

How it works:

- You contact us and explain the computing needs for your research project.
- We meet with you and ask any follow-up questions necessary to determine the best available options.
- We explore these and return to you with our recommendations.

## **Consultation topics**

Our team provides consultation on anything related to accessing SDRE. Some of our more common consultation topics are outlined below, but feel free to get in touch if you have different questions.

### **Grant application review and in-kind contributions**

Our staff can provide advice on all aspects of your grant related to **contributed hardware to SDRE**. This includes:

- Assisting with research grant proposals together with research services.
- Providing information about in-kind contributions for technology.
- Reviewing your research design to ensure compatibility with software, methods, and computing and storage infrastructure.
- Providing cost estimates for advanced research computing equipment and services.
- Suggesting compute and storage resources to handle data from sensors, microscopes, and other lab equipment.

Please plan a consultation with us early in your proposal process for full review and feedback.

### **Post-award support**

We can provide a variety of specialized supports for active research projects, including:

- Housing your research computing equipment in our data centre.

- Configuring and troubleshooting research software in remote or cluster computing environments.

- Training researchers in using advanced research computing environments.

- Software installation services.

## **Preparing for your consultation**

----

We want you to get the most out of your consultation. Here are a few questions we like to ask:

- Is this a funded/active project?
- What is your budget?
- How much data do you have or expect to generate?
- Do you have or plan to buy specialized computing equipment?

If you don't have answers yet, don't worry! An initial consultation may be just the first step in the support for your project.

Please contact us as early as possible in your project's lifecycle, as some things can take time to implement and support.
