# **Introduction to High Performance Computing at SDRE**

----

## **Are you a candidate for High Performance Computing (HPC)?**

----

- Are your data sets getting big enough to crash your desktop computer?
- Does your simple analysis program only take an hour...but you need to run it 1000 times?
- Are your lab computers covered with threatening Post-it notes saying ***Running Simulation: DO NOT REBOOT*** ?

When you can't perform your research in a reasonable amount of time with the resources you have on hand, it is time to discover HPC.

## **How do I get started?**

----

Please see [Account Request](/pages/basics/account_request/) section.

## **What if you're not a "computer person"?**

----

If the idea of HPC is intimidating, please note that one of the services of SDRE group is user support and training.

We currently have:

- A website with extensive documentation, including video tutorials

- A text based Quick Start Tutorial or a Video Tutorial that takes you from basic Linux all the way through to submitting parallel jobs

- Consultation and support for using HPC 

- Formal workshops and training events

- An open invitation for personal consultations in the form of group specific consultations or training, one-on-one discussions, or virtual meetings with Google Meet or Zoom

## **What if you're a "computer person" ready to take the next step?**

----

HPC staff are not domain experts and do not know every software package, but they can give you advice on:

- Workflow automation and optimization
- Code profiling and performance monitoring
- Parallel programming
- Software installation and troubleshooting

## **We look forward to working with you.**

So take a look at what SDRE has to offer and schedule a [consultation](/pages/basics/consultation.md) any time.
